# Daily Log — 2026-02-04 (Wednesday)

## Plan for Today

### Redis Auth / API Security (Backend)
- [x] `P1` Test REST calls (Postman)
- [x] `P1` Create feature build (Bitbucket Pipelines)
- [ ] `P1` Code review (Daniel)
- [ ] `P1` Check in to dev

### WebSocket Reconnect (Frontend)
- [ ] `P1` Lofi WebSocket reconnect
- [ ] `P1` Application WebSocket reconnect
- [ ] `P1` Test reconnection in dev

### Setup Mobile (Frontend) — PRIORITY TOMORROW
- [ ] `P1` Check WebSocket in mobile before beta deploy
- [ ] `P1` Finalize Android build with Daniel (app hang issue)

### Blazor (Backend)
- [x] `P1` Check in to develop (options expirations page) — already in dev
- [ ] `P1` **INVESTIGATE:** How did feature get into dev 5 days ago?
- [ ] `P1` Restore app.json config changes into develop
- [ ] `P1` Investigate build/publish pipeline (msbuild or Jenkins → Gitea)

## Accomplished Today

### Redis Auth (Backend)
- [x] Found issue: POST not explicitly denied
- [x] Fixed: Explicitly deny PUT/POST/DELETE REST calls
- [x] Tested REST calls
- [x] Created feature build (Bitbucket Pipelines)
- [ ] Code review (Daniel)
- [ ] Fixing feature branch issues

### Blazor (Backend)
- [x] Found: options expirations page already in develop (5 days ago)
- [ ] Investigate how it got there 

## Projects Created Today
- Feature Flag WebSocket (FE) — deliver flags via WS instead of Redis
- Blazor Build Pipeline (BE) — msbuild or Jenkins → Gitea

## Notes

- Toby: push options expirations changes to dev
- Toby: investigate build pipeline — msbuild for publish script OR Jenkins for compilation → output to Gitea
- Need to clarify exact approach with Toby
- **Issue:** feature/options-expirations-page-restore branch shows checked in 5 days ago — investigating
- Tried ioredis → node-redis switch: failed (TS `?` operand incompatible) — reverted
- Feature build failed due to above — needs rebuild
- Android build pushed to tomorrow's priority 

## Carried Over
- Redis Auth: in code review (Daniel)
- Android build: setup complete, blocked on app hang before login
